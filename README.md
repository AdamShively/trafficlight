# Traffic-Light-Simulator
A traffic light simulator that uses Arduino and any compatable circuit board. Top row of lights represent the major road and bottom row represents minor road lights. 
Lights cycle just like real traffic lights and the user can press the buttons which represent a pedestrian waiting to cross major or minor roads. Speaker beeps when pedestrian can cross and beeps more rapidly as pedestrian runs out of time to cross. The blue LED represents a pedestian crossing light.
