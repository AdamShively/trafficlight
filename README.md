# Traffic-Light-Simulator
A traffic light simulator that uses Arduino and any compatable circuit board. Top row of lights represent the major road and bottom row represents minor road lights. 
Lights cycle just like real traffic lights. The left button represents a pedestrian wanting to cross the major road who presses a crosswalk button. The two buttons on the right side of the board represent a pedestrian wanting to cross the minor road who presses the crosswalk button (the left button of the two) and the other represents a sensor that becomes active when a car on the minor road is waiting to cross the major road.  Speaker beeps when pedestrian can cross and beeps more rapidly when the pedestrian is running out of time to cross. The blue LEDs represents a pedestian crossing light. 


# How-To
The use, one should have the Arduino environment and any compatible board kit with a setup similar to the one shown below.
